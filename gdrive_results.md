Dear  Samuel,  
I  wanted  to  follow  up  on  our  discussion  regarding  last  month’s  trade  on  the  GBP/USD  pair.  As  
you
 
recall,
 
we
 
entered
 
the
 
position
 
on
 
March
 
12th
 
when
 
the
 
pair
 
was
 
trading
 
at
 
1.2615,
 
following
 
the
 
Bank
 
of
 
England’s
 
rate
 
decision.
 
Our
 
analysis
 
indicated
 
that
 
the
 
market
 
was
 
underpricing
 
the
 
risk
 
of
 
a
 
dovish
 
pivot,
 
and
 
given
 
the
 
U.S.
 
inflation
 
report
 
released
 
that
 
morning,
 
we
 
expected
 
a
 
sharp
 
move
 
toward
 
dollar
 
strength.
 
We
 
structured
 
the
 
trade
 
as
 
a
 
short
 
position
 
with
 
a
 
50-pip
 
stop-loss
 
at
 
1.2665
 
and
 
an
 
initial
 
target
 
at
 
1.2450,
 
ensuring
 
our
 
risk-reward
 
ratio
 
remained
 
favorable
 
at
 
1:3.
 
The
 
position
 
sizing
 
was
 
adjusted
 
to
 
account
 
for
 
potential
 
volatility,
 
and
 
we
 
allocated
 
a
 
total
 
of
 
$500,000
 
notional
 
value
 
to
 
the
 
trade.
 
By  the  following  week,  price  action  confirmed  our  thesis.  The  dollar  index  surged  as  expected,  
and
 
GBP/USD
 
retraced
 
to
 
1.2500
 
by
 
March
 
18th.
 
However,
 
given
 
the
 
Federal
 
Reserve’s
 
unexpected
 
shift
 
in
 
tone
 
during
 
their
 
policy
 
statement
 
on
 
March
 
20th,
 
we
 
faced
 
a
 
brief
 
retracement
 
to
 
1.2575.
 
At
 
that
 
point,
 
we
 
discussed
 
whether
 
to
 
exit
 
early
 
or
 
maintain
 
the
 
position.
 
After
 
reviewing
 
the
 
technical
 
levels,
 
particularly
 
the
 
resistance
 
forming
 
at
 
1.2580,
 
we
 
decided
 
to
 
hold.
 
The
 
following
 
day,
 
a
 
weaker-than-expected
 
U.K.
 
GDP
 
report
 
accelerated
 
the
 
downside
 
move,
 
allowing
 
us
 
to
 
take
 
partial
 
profits
 
at
 
1.2470.
 
We
 
adjusted
 
our
 
stop-loss
 
to
 
breakeven
 
and
 
let
 
the
 
remaining
 
position
 
run.
 
Ultimately,  our  patience  paid  off,  and  we  closed  the  trade  entirely  at  1.2415  on  March  25th,  
securing
 
a
 
total
 
gain
 
of
 
200
 
pips.
 
This
 
resulted
 
in
 
a
 
profit
 
of
 
approximately
 
$79,400
 
after
 
accounting
 
for
 
spreads
 
and
 
commissions.
 
Reviewing
 
the
 
trade,
 
I
 
believe
 
our
 
entry
 
and
 
risk
 
management
 
were
 
well-executed,
 
though
 
we
 
may
 
want
 
to
 
refine
 
our
 
approach
 
to
 
handling
 
policy-related
 
volatility.
 
Let’s
 
discuss
 
further
 
refinements
 
during
 
our
 
next
 
strategy
 
session.
 
Looking
 
forward
 
to
 
your
 
thoughts.
 
Best,  
Jonathan
